# Do not confuse this with database schemas(called models in this Project)! 
# Schemas can be thought of as structs which make sending and recieving requests/responses in JSON format easier 
# 1.Make schemas according to the data we need from the current endpoint's request eg: Register doesnt need avgGuestRating, Login doesn't need PhoneNo etc
# 2.Make schemas according to the data we need to send as the current endpoint's response eg: We can return a whole ORM Model but the response_model only has few attrs from it
# We need orm_mode in 2 but not in 1. Read ORM Mode here: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/ also check (bitfumes 2:10:00)
